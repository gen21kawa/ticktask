## Development

This project was developed entirely using **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)**, Anthropic's AI-powered coding assistant.

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an advanced AI assistant that can:
- Write, debug, and refactor code
- Design software architecture
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Implement best practices and security measures
- Generate tests and handle edge cases

### Development Process

The entire TickTask project was created through natural language conversation with Claude Code, including:

- 📐 **Architecture Design**: Project structure and module organization
- 💻 **Implementation**: All Python code, including async operations and OAuth2 flow
- 📚 **Documentation**: README, docstrings, and user guides
- 🔒 **Security**: Encrypted token storage and secure credential handling
- 🎨 **User Experience**: CLI design with Rich formatting
- 🧪 **Testing Structure**: Test templates and examples
- 📦 **Packaging**: Setup files and distribution configuration

### Human Contribution

The human developer:
- Provided project requirements and goals
- Guided the overall direction
- Will maintain and deploy the project
- Manages the GitHub repository and credentials

### AI Contribution

Claude Code:
- Wrote 100% of the source code
- Created all documentation
- Designed the architecture
- Implemented security best practices
- Structured the project for maintainability

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted development:
- **Rapid Development**: Complete project built in a single session
- **Best Practices**: Automatic implementation of industry standards
- **Comprehensive**: Full project including docs, tests, and security
- **Maintainable**: Clean, well-structured code ready for future development
